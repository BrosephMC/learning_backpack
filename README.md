# learning_backpack

Extended descriptions of functionality and documentation can be found in the "docs" directory:

- A basic layout of the project requirements can be found in the "Project requirements.txt" file. This is somewhat depreciated, and should be revised after client discussions

- The terminology used in the documentation, comments, and development is in the "Backpack Terminology.txt" file- again, some terms need to be added/revised after client discussion

- List of Bugs.txt is a list of bugs present in the code. Update each sprint.

- Future Development Tasks.txt is a simple list of things to develop along with their priority. Use and update this after client discussions, or if the Kardia tasks get lost.

- Enumerated Documentation.txt is a passion project to sic documentatino people onto. No, seriously, it's for adding codes to each inline comment so that users can reference this text file with a super in depth hierarchy for how stuff is organized, what file code is in, add written explanations for what the code is supposed to do, include the lines in the file where the code is found, and go line-by-line explaining why the code works the way it does or what the heck we were thinking when we wrote it. Also because Dart/Flutter has a learning curve we need to bring down to be efficient developers.

- nextDev folder is a graveyard (currently empty) for prototype code that cannot be completed in a sprint. Format it with comments explaining what doesn't work and why.


All documentation will be reformatted towards the end of the current development cycle for consistency.
