# learning_backpack
 
I updated the README. The project description or other documentation should go here

Extended descriptions of functionality and documentation can be found in the "docs" directory:
- A basic layout of the project requirements can be found in the "Project requirements.txt" file
- The terminology used in the documentation, comments, and development is in the "Backpack Terminology.txt" file
- A slightly more structured document showing an overview of code structure/functionality is in "Algorithm 1 prototype.docx"
    
All documentation will be reformatted towards the end of the current development cycle for consistency.
