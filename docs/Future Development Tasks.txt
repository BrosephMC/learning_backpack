This file describes remaining development tasks for future teams. Update this as necessary.

REQUIRED CLIENT TASKS:
-Trailmap:
	-Add visibility features to Trailmap Trails and Tasks
	-Add ability to have "groups" of people on the same/multiple trails, with user management options

-Backpack:
	-Sort Backpack contents: UI undeveloped, but process and protype code are in the "nextDev" folder
	-Implement a cloud save/download/share functionality
	-Add a file sharing function (primarily in-app, but using default share services such as text/email works as a secondary)
	-Have a system for adding tags to backpack items, so they can be sorted, searched, and otherwise categorized by users
	

-Badges: track learning progress independent of specific "trails" (not implemented, but tab for loading menu/UI is there)
	-Design the UI and appearance of badges and the terms/hierarchy of how they upgrade with progress
	-Visibility and privacy settings for badges, including searching for users rith those badges, or trails related to them.
	-Design a system to detect badge eligibility, track completion level, and lock awarding of badges to admin accounts over a user
	-Have separate screens for viewing an individual badge's info and a user's collection of badges.

NICE TO HAVE FEATURES:
-A graph/pie chart chowing a user's competencies and skills based upon progress
-Show related competencies/trails in UI based upon tags
-The Sort function (backpack) could use more tags to sort by
-Sorting backpack items by extension currently doesn't sort entries within groups of extension types, i.e.PDFs are grouped, but not alphebetized or sorted by size
	*Current implementation sorts each extension group alphatetically, but there may be edge cases where this isn't useful.

EXPANDING FUNCTIONALITY AND SECURITY:
- Change the path_provider functionality (for saving files in the backpack module) to file_saver for expanded functionality (https://pub.dev/packages/file_saver)
- Optimize the code for saving/opening/deleting files in the backpack (It's stable and functional, but technically inefficient)
- Review the main() file and separate into multiple files for easier development
